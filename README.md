### Overview
WRAAM (Work Request and Asset Manager) will allow administrator created users to create and search for work requests, marking them as complete when the work is finished. This website will be directed toward the needs of a small University or college, focusing on cutting costs with a self-owned application and solving issues that cannot be resolved with a web application not specifically created for their needs. 

### Features
-**Save and Edit Work Requests:** User should be able to create and edit work requests so that other users can view what work needs to be done and get updated information.

-**Search Work Requests:** Users will be able to view all work requests and filter them to find the work request that they are looking for.

-**User login:** Users can login once an administrator has created an account for them. Nothing should be accessible without first logging in. 

-**Add Users:** Adminstrators should be able to add new users as more employees are hired, this way they have control over who can access the information. Later adding a delete user option would be great.

-**Search and View Buildings:** Users will be able to view and search through buildings to find more detailed information, these buildings cannot be edited by users. Only an administrator can add or edit buildings.

-**Home Page/Dashboard:** User should have a landing page that makes the web application more accessible and easier to use. This would include adding a graph of work orders in each building if there is time.

### Technologies
Java 8

Spring Boot

Thymeleaf

MySQL

Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to edit a work request through an additional form, this will
allow the user to update information on the work request, like the status.
Learning how to create administrator accounts that create and edit users would also benefit
the functionality of WRAAM.
I could also learn how to properly allow a user to select a building.
Using a dropdown is an option, but on a larger campus making a search/autopopulate
connected to the buildings would be better.
