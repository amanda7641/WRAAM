### Overview
WRAAM (Work Request and Asset Manager) will allow administrator created users to create and search for work requests,
marking them as complete when the work is finished. This website will be directed toward the needs of a small education
or business campus, focusing on cutting costs with a self-owned application and solving issues that cannot be resolved
with a web application not specifically created for their needs.

### Features
-**Save and Edit Work Requests:** User should be able to create and edit the status of work requests so that other users
can view what work needs to be done and get updated information.

-**Search Work Requests:** Users will be able to view all work requests and filter them to find the work request that they are looking for.

-**User login:** Users can login once an administrator has created an account for them. Nothing should be accessible without first logging in. 

-**Add Users:** Administrators should be able to add new users as more employees are hired, this way they have control
over who can access the information. This means that a user should also be able to change their password, since the original will be
initialized by the administrator. Later adding a delete user, or deactivate user, option would be helpful.

-**View Buildings and Add:** Users will be able to view the list of buildings that are in the database, these buildings cannot
be edited by users. Only an administrator can add new buildings.

-**Home Page/Dashboard:** User should have a landing page that makes the web application more accessible and easier to use.
This would include adding a graph of work orders in each building if there is time.

### Technologies
Java 8

Spring Boot

Thymeleaf

MySQL

Bootstrap

Javascript

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to edit a work request through an additional form, this will
allow the user to update information on the work request, like the status.
Learning how to create administrator accounts that create and edit users would also benefit
the functionality of WRAAM.
I could also learn how to properly allow a user to select a building.
Using a dropdown is an option, but on a larger campus making a search/autopopulate
connected to the buildings would be better.
